## Introduction
Attendance Management System is designed to automate the process of taking attendance in educational institutions or any other settings where attendance tracking is required. It uses face recognition technology to identify individuals and record their attendance.

## Features
- Face detection and recognition for attendance tracking.
- Support for multiple programs and subjects.
- User-friendly interface for adding new users and starting attendance sessions.
- Automatically generates attendance reports in CSV format.
- Prevents duplicate attendance records for the same individual on the same day and subject.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/attendance-management-system.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Download the pre-trained face detection model: [haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencv/opencv/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml)
4. Place the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file in the project directory.

## Usage
